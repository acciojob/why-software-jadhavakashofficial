  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I’ve always been fascinated by technology and the power it has to solve
    problems and improve people’s lives. From building applications that
    automate daily tasks to creating software that connects communities,
    being a developer allows me to continually learn and innovate.
